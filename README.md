# signature_tool

<< TODO: Clean up the code & add user config (as everything is either hardcoded or spread around the whole script, huge mess..)

Powershell script that automatically creates Outlook email signatures for Active Directory users.

Script is provided with a sample email signature, located in "templates" folder, copy the folder contents to "%AppData%\Microsoft\Signatures" & edit through Outlook (File -> Options - Mail -> Signatures).

sg_generate.ps1 generates 2x signatures for every AD user (unless added to $ignore_list): new_msg & reply_msg and places them all in user_signatures folder.

sg_autostart.ps1 should be setup through GPO to execute on start & placed somewhere on a file server that is accessible to the users. Enabling Powershell script code execution is dangerous, use at your own risk (this is just proof of concept).

sg_generate.ps1 basically takes the templates and replaces variables in it; FullNameVar, TitleVar, EmailVar, PhoneVar, MobileVar etc.
Keep in mind that the script pulls data from Active Directory user attributes - if your users don't have their details on their AD profiles, it probably won't work for you.

Considering this would be ran as an autostart on Windows login - the script generates a file with date on generation of the signature, so that once the signature is copied to the machine, it does not copy it again (or overwrite):
generate signatures -> date x -> user logins -> does the signature exist: no? copy it; yes? -> compare dates: date same as generation date; yes -> skip; no: update the signature
